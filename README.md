- 👋 Hi, I’m @hiveMC3310

A very young developer. 
Since I was 14 years old I started my way. My name is Nikita. I was born and live in Russia, in not the richest family. 
I am not working yet and have not fully decided on my field, so far I am trying everything 👀. 
Since childhood I have loved math, physics and now programming 😍. 
It gives me pleasure 😊
